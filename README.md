# Medicine Donation

Welcome to the Medicine Donation repository! This project aims to provide a platform for individuals and organizations to donate unused or unexpired medicines to those in need. By donating medicines, you can help reduce healthcare costs and improve access to essential medications for people who cannot afford them.

## Getting Started

To get started with donating medicines, please follow these steps:

1. Check the expiration date: Make sure that the medicines you wish to donate have not expired or are close to expiring.

2. Sort and package the medicines: Sort the medicines into separate bags or boxes according to their type (e.g., painkillers, antibiotics, etc.). Label each bag/box with the name of the medicine and the expiration date.

3. Find a donation center: Search for a local medicine donation center or organization that accepts medicine donations. You can also check with your local pharmacy, hospital, or doctor's office.

4. Drop off the medicines: Deliver the sorted and packaged medicines to the donation center during their business hours.
